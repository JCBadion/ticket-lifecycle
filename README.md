The beginning of a ticket's lifecycle begins with someone submitting a ticket to report a problem or they have an inquiry. In this case, Jacob Maxwell, one of the workers there, is putting in a ticket because his laptop suddenly no longer turns on, and he has an meeting with a client later that day.

<p>
From here we can see that the ticket has been created and is now in the system. However, no one has been assigned to this specific ticket yet, so Bob James assigns this ticket to Jake Hardwell who works in Support, and changes the SLA of this ticket to SEV-C, determining that this issue needs to be resolved sooner.

</p>
<p>
After Bob makes these changes to the ticket, the ticket thread will indicate that changes have indeed been made by Bob, showing that he did change the SLA and assigned someone to this ticket. This is done to continuous track a ticket's journey through the system until it is either closed, resolved or deleted.

Jake see's the ticket appear in his inbox because Bob assigned it to him. Jake appears to sympathize with Jacob because of their broken laptop and immediately transfers the ticket over to Todd Howard who works in maintenance to help resolve Jacob's laptop issues. According to the ticket thread, Jake reassigns this ticket to Todd, requesting that he helps fix Jacob's laptop, then transfers the ticket over to the Maintenance department. As soon as Jake hits transfer, the ticket will no longer register on his account.

<p>
Jacob's ticket reaches its final destination with Todd Howard. Todd see's the ticket and promptly responds with having Mark sent over to check up on their laptop. Todd then states that if Jacob has any further questions regarding their laptop, that Jacob should send an email if there is any other problem with it. He then finishes the ticket by marking it as resolved in the ticketing system, thus closing the ticket for the time being.
